###WHAT? 

JUMBLE is a Node.js app built for my group project during my course at General Assembly.

Somewhere between Pinterest, Stumbleupon and a news service, JUMBLE offers videos and news stories based on User's category choices (over 50). The recommendations are then shown in a Pinterest type way for User's to view and enjoy.

###TECH?

The site was built using Node.js, with a non relational database. The front end requests are created using AJAX.
We used the external API's of The Guardian newspaper, Youtube and Getty Images. We also looked into Associated Press but did it not make the cut.
For the newspaper articles, we used a web scraper to scrape the articles so we could display in our own style.
Styling was completed using CSS and Bootsrap.
